// What the account API's `/v2/remote/*` responses mean, for every client that connects through it.
//
// `apps/auth-api` serves them and two independent clients read them: `src/main/central-auth-manager.ts`
// on the desktop and `packages/team-client/src/remote-directory.ts` on mobile. Each carried its own
// copy of these shapes, including the Signal URL scheme check - a security rule that decides whether
// a ticket may be carried over an unencrypted socket, and the one thing two implementations of the
// same response must never disagree about.
//
// Decoding only. The request plumbing stays with each client because it genuinely differs: the
// desktop reads its session token per call, times out at ten seconds and raises an `AuthApiError`
// that carries the API's own error code to the renderer; the shared client holds a fixed bearer
// token and raises a `RemoteDirectoryError`. What they share is what the bytes mean.
//
// Guards rather than zod, like the rest of this package: it is in the graph of a Cloudflare Worker,
// an Expo app and an Electron renderer, and there is no runtime dependency to spend.
