/**
 * The two addresses one plugin listing has: the page a person shares, and the link that opens that
 * listing in the app.
 *
 * ```
 * https://openbot.run/plugins/<slug>    the link a person shares and the app copies
 * openbot://plugins/<slug>              the link the page button opens
 * ```
 *
 * The host gives the kind and the path gives the argument, which is the rule `parseInviteUrl`
 * already follows with `hostname === "join"`. An invite needs four fields and so needs a query; a
 * plugin needs one identifier, so a path segment is enough. Refusing a query outright is what stops
 * the shape growing an `?install=1` later.
 *
 * Both forms are *built* from a slug and never read out of catalog data. A listing therefore cannot
 * put a foreign address behind the button that says it copies its own link.
 *
 * `invite-links.ts` is untouched by this: it owns `join`, and the router asks it first, so no invite
 * rule becomes weaker.
