// The Signal wire protocol: the frames a peer and the Signal service exchange over `WSS /v1/signal`.
//
// Signal (`remote/api`) relays SDP and ICE between a host and its clients and hands out resume
// tokens and TURN credentials. It never sees a chat, a file or a command - those travel on the
// WebRTC data channels it helped negotiate, and their protocol is `../team-protocol` instead.
//
// Three parties speak this and none of them ships together: the service
// (`remote/api/src/signal-service.ts`), the shared client that mobile and the future web client run
// (`packages/team-client/src/remote-peer.ts`), and the desktop's hidden-window peer
// (`src/renderer/src/features/team/team-webrtc.ts`). Each wrote these shapes out by hand, and the
// desktop's copies had degraded into a flat `.loose()` bag of optionals: `sdp`, `candidate` and
// `resumeToken` were `string | undefined` on every branch, so the compiler could not tell a `ready`
// from an `ice-candidate` and every field had to be re-checked at the point of use.
//
// Types and constants only, so a client pays nothing at runtime to import them. Validation is one
// implementation per trust direction and is deliberately not shared: `remote/api` keeps its zod
// schema for the untrusted *client* input it accepts - byte limits, identifier patterns, a closed
// discriminated union - and `./decode.ts` carries the guards a client runs over the *service's*
// output. Neither is the other's mirror, and neither should grow into it.
//
// Unlike `../team-protocol` there are no frozen per-version artifacts here, because this protocol
// has only ever had one version. `version` on these frames is the socket protocol; the app protocol
// negotiated on the data channels is a different number entirely.
