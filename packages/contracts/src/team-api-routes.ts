// Every Team API path the desktop builds, in one place.
//
// The host router in `src/main/team-api/` and the client in `src/main/remote-server-client.ts`
// are two hand-written halves of one HTTP surface, and until this table every path was a bare string
// literal on both of them - plus a third copy in the IPC handlers that call through. Nothing linked
// the copies, so a rename that missed one half broke every remote server silently. The IPC channel
// version of that mistake is caught by `src/main/ipc-channel-coverage.test.ts`; this had no
// equivalent, which is why it comes with a round-trip case in `src/main/team-api-server.test.ts`.
//
// These are path *builders*, not a matcher, and every entry is exactly what the host compares
// `url.pathname` against - queries stay at the call site that knows the parameters. The host does not
// compare full paths for the parametric routes: it regex-matches `/v1/agents/:agentId` and switches on
// an action sub-segment, so a shared matcher would mean rewriting its 404 and 405 semantics. Static
// entries are for both halves; the host's regex branches stay literal.
//
// The frozen artifacts under `./team-protocol` deliberately do not import this table. `v1.ts` keeps
// its own copy of the route list because it classifies requests for a *released* wire protocol: if a
// rename here followed into it, the meaning of a shipped protocol would change, and that is the one
// thing a released adapter may never do. The duplication there is the point - do not "fix" it.
//
// The cloud account API in `apps/auth-api` serves `/v1/...` paths of its own. It is an unrelated
// service reached by `central-auth-manager.ts` and the marketplace services, and its routes do not
// belong here.

// The remote-screen namespace, exposed on the group below as `prefix` because it is rewritten as a
// *string inside a served body*, not built as a path: `remote-viewer-proxy.ts` prefixes every
// occurrence in the viewer's HTML and JavaScript with its own server-scoped base, so a rename here
// that the proxy did not follow would leave those assets pointing outside the proxy and 404. The
// group's entries are built from it so there is one source, not a fifth copy.
