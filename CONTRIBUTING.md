# Contributing to Dani-Dex

Thanks for helping improve Dani-Dex. Pull requests with clear verification are the easiest to
review.

## Before opening an issue

- Search existing issues first.
- Use the security process in `SECURITY.md` for vulnerabilities.
- Remove credentials, private file paths, conversation contents, and personal data from diagnostics.
- Include the Dani-Dex version, macOS version, Mac architecture, provider, CLI version, and
  reproduction steps for bugs.

## Development setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nightly-labs/openbot.git
cd openbot
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run check
bun run dev
```

The supported toolchain is pinned in `package.json`. Use stable Bun 1.4.0, TypeScript 5.9, Vite 7, and the
existing Biome configuration. Biome is the only lint and format tool. Do not add a second linter,
Prettier, a second state library, or a UI kit without first discussing the architectural cost.
The Biome configuration also loads the repository-owned GritQL rules in
`tools/biome/anti-slop/rules`. Fix these findings at the domain boundary. Do not suppress a rule or
replace a concrete contract with a broad dictionary type.

Biome's `suspicious/noImportCycles` rejects circular imports across the whole repository, so runtime
imports point in one direction. When two modules need each other, move the shared piece into a third
module both can import — as `features/conversation/conversation-controller-context.tsx` does for the
conversation controller, and `features/team/team-typing.ts` for the one IPC call two differently
scoped owners both need.
Type-only imports (`import type`) are erased by the compiler and stay allowed in both directions.

## Pull requests

1. Create a branch from `main`.
2. Add or update tests for behavior changes and reproduced bugs.
3. Run `bun run check`. Coding agents do not: see [AGENTS.md, Checks](AGENTS.md#checks).
4. Describe user-visible changes, risks, and manual verification in the pull request.

Do not commit generated `out`, `dist`, coverage, local browser profiles, Electron `userData`, CLI
state, `.env` files, credentials, real conversations, or user attachments.

### Answering the NorbiAI review

Every push to a branch in this repository runs the automated reviewer, and it blocks the merge on
an unresolved P0 or P1 finding. A pull request from a fork is the exception: GitHub gives a fork's
push run a read-only token, so it could not publish a review even if it produced one. Ask a
maintainer to add the `norbiai` label, or to comment `/norbiai review`. Both run this
repository's own copy of the workflow, where the token can publish, and either can be repeated
after a push — the label is removed once the review runs, so re-applying it asks again. Two ways
past a finding:

1. Fix it and push. The next review classifies the finding `[RESOLVED]`.
2. Show it is wrong. Comment the concrete reason — the guard it misses, the line that already
   handles it — and include `/norbiai review` anywhere in the same comment. The reviewer rechecks
   that finding against your argument and marks it `[WITHDRAWN]`, which stops blocking and stays
   recorded under `## Withdrawn Findings` so a later push does not raise it again.

A rebuttal needs something checkable in it. "Intended", "out of scope", or a promise to fix it
later leaves the finding `[REMAINS]`, and the reviewer says which part it could not verify. Only
comments from someone who can merge the pull request are read — organization membership on its own
is not enough, and on a fork that means the recheck has to be asked for by a maintainer rather than
by you — and only those written after the review being answered, plus the comment that asked for
the recheck whatever its timestamp says. That one is passed to the reviewer whole; the older
responses share a size budget and are dropped from the oldest end. A label carries no argument of
its own, so write the rebuttal as a comment first and label afterwards.

### Choosing the reviewer for one pull request

The reviewer runs on a default model and reasoning effort set in
[`.github/workflows/norbiai-review.yml`](.github/workflows/norbiai-review.yml). A pull request that
needs a closer read, or one small enough not to need the slowest one, can pick its own with two
directives, each on a line of its own in the pull request description:

```
NorbiAI-Model: chatgpt-web/pro
NorbiAI-Effort: high
```

Wrap a directive in `<!-- -->` to keep it out of the rendered description. A directive inside a
fenced code block is an example and is not read, so a pull request may show one without changing its
own review. Each is optional: leave one out and that half keeps the default. The choice applies to this pull request only — nothing is
written back, so the next one starts from the defaults again — and the review comment records under
`Review details` which reviewer actually ran.

`NorbiAI-Effort` reaches `gpt-6-astra` only. A `chatgpt-web/*` slug carries its own level — the
`high` in `chatgpt-web/high` is the reasoning level, already chosen — so pair the effort with
`gpt-6-astra` or it changes nothing. `gpt-6-astra` itself is capped at `low`: asking for more is
answered with a warning and the run goes ahead at `low`.

The same two directives work in a `/norbiai review` comment, where they override the description for
that one run. On a pull request from a fork only the comment is read: the description belongs to
whoever opened the pull request, and choosing your own reviewer is not theirs to do.

`ALLOWED_MODELS` and `ALLOWED_EFFORTS` in the workflow file are the accepted values. Anything else
is refused with a warning and the default runs instead, so a typo reviews at full strength rather
than at none. The value is the whole rest of the line, so keep the directive on its own: a trailing
note makes the line unrecognised rather than being trimmed off it. The review still has to finish
inside the job's own time limit, whichever model runs.

## Security-sensitive changes

Preserve the following boundaries and their tests:

- Electron sandboxing, context isolation, navigation policy, and IPC sender validation.
- Attachment realpath, MIME, size, quota, and managed-protocol checks.
- Queue serialization, idempotency, crash reconciliation, and atomic persistence.
- The remote browser session's lack of preload and `window.danidex` access.
- Secret redaction and agent child-process cleanup.

Full agent access is intentional today, but new privileges or network surfaces still require an
explicit threat-model note in the pull request.

## Dependencies

Prefer the platform and existing dependencies. A new runtime dependency should remove more
complexity than it adds, have a compatible open-source license, and be justified in the pull request.
Keep tool versions pinned; compatibility upgrades should be isolated and verified by the full check.

## Licensing

By submitting a contribution, you agree that it is your original work (or that you have the right to
submit it) and that it is licensed under the repository's PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0 license. Do
not submit copied UI assets, proprietary code, private plugin binaries, or material whose license is
unclear.
