# ui-foundation fixture

A miniature `src/renderer/src` that breaks every check in `scripts/ui-foundation-check.ts`,
beside correct code each check must leave alone. Where a check names two things that can break
independently - `@kobalte/core` and `lucide-solid`, a hex colour and a named one - each gets its
own line here, because one of them firing says nothing about the other. `scripts/ui-foundation-check.test.ts`
asserts the resulting report line for line, so a check that stops matching turns red here instead of
staying green in CI.

Nothing here is compiled, linted or rendered — `biome.json` excludes the directory and no tsconfig
includes it. Treat every file as data read by the test.

`features/inbox` is not stray either: the composite role count walks the whole renderer rather than
`components/`, so it takes a component living beside its domain to hold that scope in place.

`components/ui-kit` is not a typo: it is the neighbour that proves skipping the design system
compares a path prefix against a separator rather than against `components/ui` alone.

`styles/unreachable.css` and its neighbours are the one check here that reports per class rather than
per file, so every branch of it fits in a single stylesheet: the classes that must be reported, and
beside them one reached from a class attribute, one reached only from `preview/preview.html`, and one
reached only by a `prefix-${value}` family inside a multi-line class array. Their names appear nowhere
else in this tree on purpose — the scan reads words, so naming a class in a comment would make it
reachable and quietly retire the branch.

Adding a check to the script means adding the file that trips it here, beside the neighbour it must
ignore. If the check reports once per file rather than once per occurrence, that neighbour cannot live
here — the violation would account for the failure either way — so it goes in `../renderer-clean`.
