// Three layers, cheapest first: a CSS gradient that server-renders, the PNG baked
// at build time over it, and — for the featured card, article artwork, or a card
// under the pointer — a live WebGL canvas over both. Each layer is an improvement
// on the one below, so any of them failing leaves something that still looks like
// the article's artwork.
//
// The two still layers are two backgrounds of one element rather than an <img>.
// A background that fails to load falls through to the layer below it without
// drawing anything, while an <img> that answers 404 paints the browser's
// torn-page glyph in the corner of the card before any script can remove it. The
// images exist only in a full build, so that case is the everyday one in
// development.
//
// A CSS background starts that download the moment it has a URL. The reveal's
// opacity: 0 does not stop it, and neither does sitting below the fold, so a
// card keeps the PNG off the element until it is near the viewport. Featured
// and article artwork keep theirs from the first paint: they are on screen as
// the page opens, and the index already preloads the featured still.
//
// The reason for the staging is context budget. A browser allows on the order of
// eight to sixteen live WebGL contexts and drops the oldest without warning past
// that. The index page shows one featured card and a grid, so "live" is used once
// and everything else waits to be hovered. Article pages keep their artwork live;
// the page is short, and the visible article backgrounds share that motion.
//
// The still has to be the animation's own first frame, or the moment the shader
// arrives is a cut between two different pictures. The baked PNG is drawn from
// this same description at `gradient.frame` with the clock stopped, so it is that
// frame — but only in a full build, and only at the shape it was baked at. In
// development it answers 404, and the CSS approximation underneath is a handful of
// coloured blobs that look nothing like the shader's output.
//
// So a hover card that can move draws its own, once it is near the viewport. It mounts
// the shader with the clock stopped, keeps the frame it produced as the still, and
// lets the context go again. That picture is exact, it is the right shape because
// it was drawn at the element's own size, and it costs one short-lived context per
// card. The canvas is revealed only once it has drawn, and it fades in over that
// same frame, so the handover is never a cut and never a cut to an empty rectangle.
// A card still below the fold does not spend that context, or the encode, at all.
//
// An artwork frame that cannot move — reduced motion, or a screen with no pointer to rest —
// keeps the baked PNG. With no shader to hand over to there is no cut to avoid,
// and drawing it again would spend a context and an image encode on every card.
