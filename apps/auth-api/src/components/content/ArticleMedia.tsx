// Pictures, animations and video inside an article. A body is plain TSX, so a bare
// <img> would already render; these exist so that every picture carries the things
// that cannot be added to it afterwards: a text alternative, its own size — so the
// prose under it does not jump when the file lands — a caption where it needs one,
// and, for anything that moves, a way to stop it.
//
// Each file is imported rather than written as a path, and lives beside the body
// that uses it in `src/content/<collection>/media/<slug>/`. Vite then fingerprints
// it and fails the build on a file that is not there, so a renamed picture cannot
// ship as a broken one, and a replaced picture is never served from a cache under
// the name of the old one.
//
// Motion starts from the reader's own setting. That setting cannot be read on the
// server, so the markup takes the safe side of the question — an animated image
// leaves the choice to a media query, and a clip simply does not start — and the
// component takes the answer over once the page has hydrated. From that point the
// reader can also overrule it in either direction, which is the part a media query
// cannot do.
