              I built Dani-Dex because I wanted teammates, not chats. A chat window forgets. A teammate keeps the folder
              it works in, the history of what it did, and a name you can call it by.

            <p>
              Four things belong to an agent, and all four survive a restart and a change of model: a workspace, a
              thread, an identity, and a private provider session. Move an agent from Codex to Claude and only the
              thinking changes.
