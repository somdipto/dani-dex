 * The page cannot ask whether the app is installed, and it must not try: a hidden frame that probes
 * the scheme is a fingerprint. So the offer is a reveal on a timer, cancelled when the tab is hidden
 * - which is what happens when the app really does take over. A visitor who has Dani-Dex never sees
 * it, and a visitor who does not sees it a moment later. Neither is redirected anywhere.
 *
 * The offer is a modal `<dialog>` rather than a line on the page. A visitor sees it only after the
 * page failed to do the one thing they asked for, so it is the whole subject at that moment, and a
 * note beside the button reads as debris instead. The element is the platform's own: it takes the
 * focus, holds it, closes on Escape and gives the focus back to the button, none of which this file
 * has to write or keep true.
 *
 * The address is built from the slug through the shared helper, never read from catalog data, so a
 * listing cannot put another link behind this button.
