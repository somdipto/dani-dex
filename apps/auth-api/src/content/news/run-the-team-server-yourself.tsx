      <p>
        Dani-Dex works with no account at all. Everything that makes the app useful on your own machine — agents,
        threads, workspaces, files — is there the moment you open it, and none of it needs us.
      </p>

      <h2>What a team adds</h2>
      <p>
        A team is what you want when a second person needs to see the work. One computer runs the host, the others join
        it, and the chats and files stay on the machine that runs the host. It is your hardware and your network.
      </p>

      <h2>What the account is for</h2>
      <p>
        There is a hosted piece, and it is deliberately small. It holds accounts, avatars, memberships, invitations and
        the configuration that lets one computer find another. It does not hold your conversations, your files or your
        commands, and it is not in the path when you use the app alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        We drew that line early because it is the kind of line that is impossible to move later. Once chat history is on
        someone else's server, "local-first" is a word in the marketing copy and not a property of the software.
      </p>

      <h2>The trade you are making</h2>
      <p>
        Self-hosting means uptime is yours. If the machine that runs the host is asleep, the team is offline, and no one
        else is going to wake it up for you. That is the cost, and it is worth knowing before you build a workflow that
        depends on it.
