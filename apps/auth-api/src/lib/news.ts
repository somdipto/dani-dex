// The one list of published news articles. The index page, the article pages, the
// sitemap, the RSS feed and the build-time image generator all read it, so an
// article is added in exactly one place and nothing can fall out of step.
//
// Everything that is not the list itself lives in content-collection.ts, which
// /guides uses as well. Like that module, this one holds no JSX: article bodies
// are in src/content/news and are wired up separately.
