# Troubleshooting Dani-Dex

## Dani-Dex says agent CLI setup is required

Open Terminal and verify the CLI:

```bash
codex --version
```

If the command is missing, install Codex using the official installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.sh | sh
```

Then run `codex login`, sign in with ChatGPT, fully quit Dani-Dex, and open it again.

You can use Claude instead. Verify and install Claude CLI:

```bash
claude --version
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
claude auth login
```

If Codex is installed in a non-standard location, launch Dani-Dex with `OPENBOT_CODEX_PATH` set to the
absolute Codex executable path.

For a non-standard Claude location, set `OPENBOT_CLAUDE_PATH` to the absolute Claude executable path.

## The Linux AppImage exits immediately

On Ubuntu 23.10 or newer and on Debian 13, unprivileged user namespaces are restricted by AppArmor.
The Electron sandbox is built on one, so Dani-Dex exits during launch and writes a message about the
SUID sandbox or a user namespace to the terminal.

Install the AppArmor profile that ships with Dani-Dex, then reload AppArmor:

```bash
sudo install -m 0644 build/linux/openbot.apparmor /etc/apparmor.d/openbot
sudo systemctl reload apparmor
```

The same file is inside the AppImage at `resources/linux/openbot.apparmor`. The profile attaches to
the usual places to keep an AppImage; if yours is somewhere else, edit the path in the profile before
you install it.

Do not start Dani-Dex with `--no-sandbox`. It is not a supported workaround. The sandbox is the
boundary between a web renderer and the rest of your computer, and Dani-Dex gives its agents full
local access on the other side of it.

## Voice prompts or remote desktop are missing on Linux

Neither is available in the Linux build. The Whisper transcription binary and the Sunshine remote
desktop runtime are built for macOS and Windows only, so the microphone control is not drawn and
remote desktop reports itself as unavailable. Everything else works as it does on the other
platforms.

## Computer Use is unavailable

Computer Use needs the `cua-driver` binary. An installed release carries it, so the panel reporting
a missing driver means a development build, or a file that was removed. On macOS it also needs the
Screen Recording and Accessibility permissions; Windows and Linux ask for no permission, so there a
driver that answers is ready. Dani-Dex starts the driver itself; it does not bypass the macOS prompts.

If an installed release reports that the driver is missing, reinstall a complete Dani-Dex package,
then start Dani-Dex again. Keep your Dani-Dex data folder. A separate driver installation cannot
repair an installed release, because the application uses only its bundled driver.

In a development checkout, run `bun run prepare:cua-driver`, then press **Try again** in the panel.
This command writes the same pinned build the release ships.
`bun run cua-driver:doctor` reports which binary Dani-Dex would use, and `OPENBOT_CUA_DRIVER_PATH`
selects a different one. The installed application ignores that variable: it runs only the driver it
was released with.

On Linux the driver reads the desktop through AT-SPI, so it needs the session bus of the desktop it
is to drive. A daemon started from a container, from `runuser`, or as root against another user's
session finds an empty accessibility tree, and `get_window_state` reports `degraded`. X11 is the
driver's fully supported Linux session. On Wayland Dani-Dex starts the driver with
`CUA_DRIVER_RS_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1`; set that variable yourself to `0` if your compositor works better
through XWayland. Window rectangles under GNOME also need the driver's own `winrects@cua` shell
extension, which its installer refreshes but does not enable for you.

If the panel reports that permissions are needed, open **System Settings → Privacy & Security** and
grant both **Screen & System Audio Recording** and **Accessibility**, then press **Check again**. A
development build asks for the grants as **Electron**, not as Dani-Dex, because the development binary
is the responsible process. For the same reason a development grant does not carry over to an
installed release, and each build must be granted once.

## A chat is missing after an update

Do not follow the reset steps below. Your messages are stored in one SQLite file, nothing copies it
before an upgrade, and moving that folder puts the only copy out of reach.

Quit Dani-Dex and start it again first. On launch Dani-Dex gives a chat back to the agent it belongs to
when an agent and its chat lose track of each other, so a restart recovers most cases on its own.

If the chat is still missing, quit Dani-Dex and read the file directly. This reports chats that no
agent currently claims, and the number of messages waiting in each:

```sh
sqlite3 "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Dani-Dex/openbot.db" \
  "SELECT t.thread_id, t.agent_id, (SELECT count(*) FROM projection_thread_messages m
     WHERE m.thread_id = t.thread_id) AS messages
   FROM projection_threads t
   LEFT JOIN projection_agents a ON a.agent_id = t.agent_id
   WHERE a.agent_id IS NULL;"
```

Any row means the messages are still on disk and are recoverable. Report the output with the details
below, and keep the folder where it is until then.

## Dani-Dex will not start and names a stored agent profile

The message reads `Stored agent profile <id> has an unreadable "<field>" value`. Your data is intact:
Dani-Dex stops before it writes anything, which is what keeps the profile as it is.

Do not follow the reset steps below, and do not move the folder. Install the current version first:
Dani-Dex now repairs a stored profile field it cannot read and keeps the agent, its chat and its
workspace, while a release from before that repair refuses to start over the same profile.

If the current version still stops, quit Dani-Dex and read the profile it names. On macOS:

```sh
sqlite3 "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Dani-Dex/openbot.db" \
  "SELECT agent_json FROM projection_agents WHERE agent_id = '<id>';"
```

On Windows, the same file is at `%APPDATA%\Dani-Dex\openbot.db`.

Report the field the message names, together with the details below. The output holds your own file
paths, so review it before you publish it.

## Reset Dani-Dex

Quit Dani-Dex before moving data. To reset application state and the shared browser profile while
keeping agent workspaces, move this folder somewhere safe:

```text
~/Library/Application Support/Dani-Dex
```

To also reset agent workspaces, managed transfers, and downloads, move this folder as well:

```text
~/Dani-Dex
```

Dani-Dex creates fresh folders on the next launch. Review and back up their contents first. Do not
remove `~/.codex` or `~/.claude` unless you intentionally want to manage CLI login and history.

## Uninstall

Quit Dani-Dex. On macOS remove `Dani-Dex.app` from Applications; on Windows use the installer's
uninstaller; on Linux delete the AppImage, `~/.local/share/applications/openbot.desktop`,
`~/.local/share/icons/openbot.png`, and `/etc/apparmor.d/openbot` if you installed the profile. If
you also want to remove local Dani-Dex data, follow the reset steps above. Agent CLIs and their data
are independent and are not removed with Dani-Dex.

## Report a problem

Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/nightly-labs/openbot/issues) for reproducible bugs. Include
the Dani-Dex version, the operating system and its version, the hardware, the provider and CLI
version, and minimal reproduction steps. Never publish tokens, `~/.codex`, `~/.claude`, conversations, private files,
Electron user data, or full unreviewed diagnostics.
