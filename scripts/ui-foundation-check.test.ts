// Two checks in ui-foundation-check.ts silently matched nothing for months. The CSS
// scan named styles.css and styles/ by hand, so a stylesheet anywhere else - and one
// was, in preview/ - fell outside it; the skip list caught .test.tsx and not .test.ts.
// Both were green the whole time, because a guard with no fixture prints "passed"
// whether it is working or blind. So the check now reads a tree that breaks every rule
// once, beside correct code each rule must leave alone, and this asserts the report
// line for line. It is the contract tools/biome/anti-slop/fixtures holds the GritQL
// rules to, applied to the one guard in this repository that is not a GritQL rule.
