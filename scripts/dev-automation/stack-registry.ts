// What a dev stack holds, so a sibling worktree never takes it.
//
// `dev-services` used to pick its ports by probing: bind 5173, and if that
// works, keep it. Nothing was written down between the probe and the moment
// Vite actually listened, which is seconds later, so two `bun run dev` calls
// started together both saw 5173 free, both claimed it, and both claimed the
// unsuffixed `Dani-Dex Dev` profile with it - two Electron clients writing one
// SQLite file. This registry closes that window: a stack publishes every port
// it won before it releases the allocation lock, and the next allocator reads
// those ports as taken whether or not anything is listening yet.
//
// It also records the pids, which is what `bun run dev:stop` needs. `pkill -f
// electron` is the alternative, and it kills the other worktrees too.
