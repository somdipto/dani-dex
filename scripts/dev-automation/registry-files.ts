// same three things, and neither can afford its own version of them:
//
//   - a directory no other account can write, because a planted record names a
//     pid and a port that a mutation command would then treat as this
//     worktree's app;
//   - a write a concurrent reader cannot catch half-finished, because a reader
//     deletes what it cannot parse and would drop a record that was still
//     being written;
//   - a way to tell a live process from a recycled pid, because a record
//     outlives a process killed with SIGKILL.
