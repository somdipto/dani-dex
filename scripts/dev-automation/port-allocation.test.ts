// first is inside it - including when the first one arrived by superseding a
// lock they both judged abandoned - and that it reads the first one's ports
// when it does get in.

// No test here waits on the clock. The second allocator's `onWait` fires when
// it has seen the lock held, and that is the observable condition the first
// one waits for before it publishes.
