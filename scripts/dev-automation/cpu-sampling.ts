// The arithmetic behind `dev:automation cpu`. Pure on purpose: no process is
// spawned and no file is read here, so every rule below is testable in Node.
//
// Why this module exists at all, rather than a one-line `ps` pipe: `ps -o %cpu`
// reports total CPU time divided by process *lifetime*. An app that was busy
// for ten seconds at start-up and idle for an hour still reports a high `%cpu`,
// and it reports it stably, run after run. That is the worst possible failure
// for an A/B comparison - a confident wrong number that does not move when the
// code gets better. The only correct reading is a delta of the cumulative
// `cputime` counter across a known wall-clock interval, which is what
// `cpuSecondsBetween` does for every consecutive pair of samples.
//
// "Percent" here is percent of one core. 100 means one core fully used; a
// machine with eight cores can therefore report more than 100 in total.
