// The catalog in the root package.json is the single place a shared dependency's
// version is written; every workspace that wants one asks for "catalog:". Nothing
// in bun enforces that, so `bun add vitest` inside a workspace silently writes a
// literal back and the versions drift apart again - which is how three workspaces
// ended up on typescript@5.9.3 while the rest ran 7.0.2, and mobile on a different
// zod than the desktop app. This test is what keeps the catalog from decaying into
// a comment.
//
// The second describe covers the other fact about these manifests that nothing
// else enforces: which of them the remote API image has to carry.
