# Dani-Dex team launch catalog

Version v2 contains 20 Skills and 15 Agents. Four Skills and four Agents are featured on first publication. All entries show the public Dani-Dex logo as their creator badge, use the publisher **Dani-Dex**, start with zero installs, and include no scheduled routines. They work from supplied material and available tools; they do not assume a connected inbox, CRM, ad account, or phone service.

## Review locally

```sh
bun run api:migrate:local
bun run marketplace:seed:local
bun run dev --isolated
```

Reuse the dev app if it is already running. Open Marketplace and search **Dani-Dex** in Skills or Agents. Local seeding adds approved catalog records to this worktree's local account database and bundles to its local preview bucket. It does not reset the Electron profile, erase other listings, or create local Agents. Install an Agent from Marketplace to use it.

## Prepare and publish

```sh
bun run marketplace:build
bun run marketplace:publish:production
```

The build writes deterministic ZIP bundles, one SVG icon per Skill, manifests, notices, and checksums to `out/marketplace-production/v2`. A Skill icon is the artwork of its category, so a listing reads as a set; the mark uses paths, not emoji, because a reader's computer may not carry the font. The publish command without flags is an offline dry run. Review the catalog and ensure the account database has migrations through `0019_marketplace_presentation.sql` before production publication.

To publish after review, authenticate Wrangler for the production account and provide `SKILLS_ADMIN_TOKEN` through the environment, then run:

```sh
bun run marketplace:publish:production -- --apply --confirm-production
```

The publisher verifies the production admin credential before writing, uploads immutable bundle and icon keys, then inserts approved Skills and Agents with their exact skill-version dependencies. It does not go through community submission limits or pending review. `--local --apply` targets only local storage; mixing local and production flags is rejected.

## Repeating and updating

Stable IDs prevent duplicate listings. Repeating the same version preserves install counts and any existing Featured choice. A seed for an older version cannot move an approved listing back from a newer version. Existing bundle versions remain available to installed Agents.

After a version has been seeded or published, increase `catalogVersion` before changing its content. Content hashes are part of immutable version IDs; changing content while reusing a numeric version intentionally fails the database uniqueness constraint. Each Agent snapshot pins its Skill versions. Existing local installations update only through the normal Marketplace update action.

Do not use the separate `skills:seed`, `agents:seed`, or `dev:seed` demo scripts to populate production. They serve development fixtures, not this launch catalog.

## Check Agent preview switching

With this worktree's dev app running and at least two local Agents, run:

```sh
bun scripts/marketplace-preview-e2e.ts --allow-mutations
```

The check switches Agents in My submissions, verifies focus and category retention, and reports card position and height for visual QA. It also switches quickly back and forth. It does not submit, install, or delete anything.
