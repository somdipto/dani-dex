# Repository guidance

## Communication

Use ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English for questions, updates, explanations, and final answers.
Keep quotations, code, commands, paths, identifiers, and required technical terms unchanged.

**Non-negotiable** rules protect user data, released contracts, and security. Change them only on
an explicit developer decision. All other rules are defaults: follow the developer's preference
and state which default you set aside. Do not argue by citing this file.

## Non-negotiable

- **Migrations are irreversible.** No backup of `danidex.db` is made before an upgrade. Preserve all
  user data and support every shipped source schema. Never assume a backup exists.
- **Released Team API adapters are permanent.** Do not change a shipped wire protocol's meaning.
- **Keep the renderer-to-main trust boundary:** Electron sandboxing, context isolation, navigation
  policy, IPC sender validation, and their tests. Coding agents already have `danger-full-access`.
- **Redact secrets** on every log, export, and send path, including diagnostics and analytics.
- **Keep PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0.** Do not add incompatible dependencies or relicense files.

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#security-sensitive-changes) when a change touches the trust
boundary or a security test, and [architecture change rules](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#change-rules) when
adding a module or moving ownership between workspaces.

## Product constraints

- Workspaces, conversations, attachments, browser data, and team data stay on the computer that
  runs Dani-Dex. Providers, visited pages, and plugins can use the network.
- **No cloud dependency for core function.** The app works without an account.
  Cloudflare holds accounts, avatars, host configuration,
  memberships, invitations, and logical sessions; it does not hold chats, files, or commands.
- The user's SQLite database is the source of truth, not a remote cache.
- Agents keep their workspace, thread, and identity across provider switches and restarts.
  Do not reset an agent to simplify state.

## Checks

Do not run broad checks locally. They overload the user's computer. This explicit user preference
replaces the previous full lint and typecheck defaults. Leave repository-wide lint, aggregate
`bun run typecheck`, full UI checks, builds, and full test suites to CI. Do not request these checks
as a routine completion or PR step.

1. In a fresh worktree, run `bun install --frozen-lockfile` first.
2. Run only the narrowest relevant test file and lint the changed files. Run checks one at a time, with one test worker where supported.
   Use `bun run test:desktop -- <path>` for one desktop or mobile test file.
3. Do not run whole-workspace TypeScript checks, `typecheck:*`, or parallel checks. Do not
   replace an aggregate command with its constituent checks. Leave broad type validation to CI
   and state what remains unverified.
4. Do not run `bun run format`: it rewrites the whole repository. Use
   `biome check --write --max-diagnostics=none <paths>` for changed files.

[Check design notes](docs/development-checks.md#check-coverage) explain CI coverage, command aliases,
and the separate Node and Bun type environments. Read them when changing checks or dependencies.

## Surfaces to check

State which surfaces a change touches. Check all affected consumers and reverse actions.

- Desktop renderer (`src/renderer`), mobile (`apps/mobile`), public web (`apps/auth-api`; no separate
  landing app), hosted-site routing (`apps/site-router`), and Signal (`remote/api`).
- IPC contracts (`packages/contracts`) and their preview implementation
  (`src/renderer/src/preview/mock-dani-dex.ts`).
- Reverse actions: snooze/unsnooze, pause/resume, revoke/reconnect, mute/unmute.
- Migrations and the separate latest schema for new databases.
- Documentation: `README.md` commands, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `PRIVACY.md` when outbound data
  changes.

## Development data and processes

- `bun run dev:seed --dry-run` is read-only.
- Never kill by process pattern, such as `pkill -f electron` or `pkill -f bun`. `bun run dev:stop`
  stops only this worktree's stack; name another one with `--pid=<supervisor pid>` or `--all`.
  For a process outside the registry, target a PID you started or ask.
- Never drive another worktree's app. Use `bun run dev:automation` for smoke checks instead of
  starting Electron directly; `snapshot` and `screenshot` are read-only, and `click` and `type`
  need `--allow-mutations` and a named instance.
- Do not delete a dead stack record you did not resolve. Stop keeps the record and exits non-zero
  when it cannot confirm a PID's identity; resolve the process, then `bun run dev:forget`. Dead
  records do not reserve ports.
- Reuse a running dev instance, or use `bun run dev --isolated` for a profile tied to this worktree.
  Use the ports the stack reports rather than a fixed port.

See [README.md — Commands](README.md#commands) for the flags these commands take, and
[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for why the registry works this way, when a dev command
does not behave as expected.

## Terms

- **bot** is not for new product code. Released names stay: Team API v1-v3 `bot`/`botId`,
  `bots.json`, `legacy-import:bots:v1`, and `~/Dani-Dex/Bots` path prefixes.
- **teammate** and **group** are prompt and UI words, never types.

Use [docs/glossary.md](docs/glossary.md) when naming a new type, table, IPC channel or product
string, or when a term in the code disagrees with the UI.

## Task-specific instructions

Read the instruction file for each directory you change. Use the
[workspace map](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#workspace-map) to find its owner.

| File | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| [src/renderer/AGENTS.md](src/renderer/AGENTS.md) | SolidJS, stores, components, palette |
| [src/main/AGENTS.md](src/main/AGENTS.md) | Renderer-to-main boundary and main-process ownership |
| [src/main/ipc/AGENTS.md](src/main/ipc/AGENTS.md) | Handler binding and endpoint registration |
| [src/backend/AGENTS.md](src/backend/AGENTS.md) | SQLite migrations and database creation |
| [packages/contracts/AGENTS.md](packages/contracts/AGENTS.md) | Frozen Team API protocols and IPC mirrors |
| [apps/auth-api/AGENTS.md](apps/auth-api/AGENTS.md) | Account Worker and D1 deployment races |
| [apps/mobile/AGENTS.md](apps/mobile/AGENTS.md) | Expo and build/simulator permissions |

Before a version bump or tag, use
[release-upgrade-safety](.agents/skills/release-upgrade-safety/SKILL.md) to audit upgrade and data-loss
risks since the last release.

## Tests

- Prefer an existing test. Add a test only for a user or caller consequence; add a file only for a
  new boundary. Skip assertions already enforced by TypeScript, Biome, or `check:ui`.
- Tests are mandatory for changes to the renderer-to-main boundary, IPC contracts, database schema
  and migrations, persisted state, secrets, provider processes, Team API wire protocols, and the
  updater. Test once at the lowest stable boundary.
- Wait for state, an event, or a promise, not elapsed time. A spy can provide the wait condition,
  such as `await waitFor(() => expect(send).toHaveBeenCalled())`; assert the user consequence after
  that wait. Do not remove synchronization because it uses a spy.
- Assert behavior and data. Query accessible roles and names; use `toHaveFocus()` for focus.
  Do not assert markup, classes, layout, animation timing, or snapshots. Use exact text only for
  product contracts, error/security messages, serialized output, or localization keys.
- Use Storybook for visual details. Do not add test IDs to avoid missing accessibility.
  Story play functions can use them; renderer `data-testid` use must stay within the existing
  `check:ui` budget of five. A new hook must replace an existing one.
- `*.test.ts` uses Node; `*.test.tsx` uses JSX and jsdom; `*.dom.test.ts` uses DOM without a
  component. Keep pure logic in Node tests.

### Check rules

- Fix errors. Assess warnings; do not make correct code worse to silence one. Do not add
  `biome-ignore`. Explain retained warnings in the PR.
- GritQL rules must match syntax, not infer domain decisions, and must not duplicate a built-in
  Biome rule. Consider traversal cost before adding a rule.
- Each rule in `tools/biome/anti-slop/rules` needs positive and negative fixtures in `../fixtures`.
  Mark rejected lines with `// flag`; verify with `scripts/anti-slop-rules.test.ts`.
- Each UI check needs both `renderer` and `renderer-clean` fixtures in `tools/ui-foundation/fixtures`.
  Verify with `scripts/ui-foundation-check.test.ts`.

Read [check design notes](docs/development-checks.md#lint-and-ui-rules) when changing these checks.
They describe the enforced syntax, fixture behavior, and reasons for removed rules.

## Pull requests

- Open a PR only when asked.
- For UI changes, show before and after. State the model and harness in the PR body.
  Do not commit screenshots or other PR review image assets to the repository.
- Do not run wider checks locally before a PR. Report focused checks and leave broad checks to CI.
- A PR needs a named reason and is not auto-approvable if it adds `biome-ignore`, `@ts-expect-error`,
  or `@ts-ignore`; disables rules through `biome.json` overrides or removes a GritQL plugin; widens
  a boundary to `any` or `unknown`; or uses an assertion to bypass a checker. Fix the domain issue,
  or explain why the rule is wrong and let the developer decide.
