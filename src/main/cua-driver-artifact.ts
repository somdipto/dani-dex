 * that is not Dani-Dex a record of each tool call.
 *
 * `CUA_DRIVER_RS_UPDATE_CHECK` stops the release check `serve` makes at startup. Dani-Dex pins the
 * driver in `native-runtime.lock.json` and packages that exact build, so the answer could only offer
 * the user an update Dani-Dex would refuse: on macOS the binary sits inside a signed application
 * bundle, and replacing it would break the signature. Off, the daemon also writes no
 * `~/.cua-driver/version_check.json`.
 *
 * The driver reads the environment before its own configuration, so these decide the question:
 * nothing a process inherits can turn them back on, and Dani-Dex writes no file, so a driver the user
 * runs themselves keeps the settings they gave it. This is why both are spread last, after any
 * inherited environment, at every place that runs the binary: the daemon, the MCP proxy each
 * provider spawns, the permission probe, and the doctor script.
