/**
 * What an `dani-dex://` or `https://openbot.run/...` link means.
 *
 * The scheme carries more than one kind of link now, so the decision of which kind a URL is has one
 * home rather than one `try` per entry point. `src/main/index.ts` has four ways a link arrives -
 * `open-url`, `continue-activity`, a second instance's argv, and this process's own argv - and each
 * of them asks this module and then acts on the answer.
 *
 * The invite parser runs first. It owns the host `join`, it is the shipped behaviour, and asking it
 * first is what stops a later kind ever claiming one of its links.
 *
 * One kind never reaches a renderer. `mcp-auth` carries an OAuth grant for an MCP server, which is
 * a secret, so `src/main/index.ts` hands it to the sign-in that is waiting for it and sends nothing
 * on. It is classified here anyway, because the four entry points must keep asking one question.
 *
 * Anything this module does not recognise is `null`, which every caller drops without a message.
 * That is the existing behaviour for junk in argv, and it is what keeps an older build safe in
 * front of a link kind it has never heard of.
