/**
 * Where an MCP authorization server sends its grant back: a listener on this machine's loopback
 * address, and nothing that leaves it.
 *
 * `dani-dex://mcp-auth` was the address before this. It is the shorter path - the operating system
 * hands the link straight to the running app - but it is not an address every authorization server
 * accepts. Canva registers a custom scheme without complaint and then refuses it at `/authorize`
 * with `Invalid redirect URI.`, which leaves the user on an error page with nothing to act on. The
 * loopback address is the redirect RFC 8252 tells a native app to use, it is what that server
 * wants, and it is accepted by every other signed-in listing Dani-Dex ships.
 *
 * So the deep link stays as the fallback for the rare machine where no loopback port can be bound,
 * and this is what a sign-in registers and sends when it is running. The port is whichever one the
 * operating system gives: RFC 8252 says an authorization server must ignore the port of a loopback
 * redirect, and the registration is remade anyway when the stored one names another address.
 *
 * The grant travels no further than this process. The page the browser is left on says only that
 * the window can be closed - the code is in the request line, and a page that repeated it would
 * put a credential in the browser's history.
