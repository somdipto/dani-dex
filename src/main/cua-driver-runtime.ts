 * The user data directory cannot hold the socket: a socket path may hold about a hundred characters,
 * and an isolated development profile spends 64 of them on a worktree hash alone.
 *
 * On Windows it is a named pipe, a name in a kernel namespace rather than a path, so it has no
 * length limit and no directory to protect. The name is random, because Windows lets a second
 * process add an instance to an existing pipe name, so a name another local process can guess could
 * be taken before the driver starts. It is kept in the profile so that it is random once rather than
