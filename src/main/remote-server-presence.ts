// is an answer to a question somebody already asked, so it is cached and returned, never announced:
// announcing it would re-render every listener for a fetch one of them requested.
//
// The cache is also what makes a lost connection legible. `markOffline` does not clear it, because
// an empty roster and a roster of people who went offline look nothing alike to a user.
