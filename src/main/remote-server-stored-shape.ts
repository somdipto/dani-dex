// The shape of `servers.json` on the user's disk, and how a file written by an older build is read.
//
// This is persisted user state with no backup: nothing copies the file before an upgrade, and the
// first write after a read replaces it. So a read that cannot make sense of one part must give back
// everything else rather than nothing -- see `readStoredRemoteServers`. `src/backend/AGENTS.md` states
// the same rule for the database; the reasoning is identical and the file is smaller.
//
// "Everything else" includes the part it could not read. An entry this build rejects is carried in
// `unreadableServers` and written back into `servers` untouched, so the file keeps every entry it
// arrived with. Dropping one would be the same data loss one step later: a server with an intact
// token and a single field this build does not recognise -- written by a newer build, or by a hand
// edit -- would vanish on the next write, and the build that understands it would never see it
// again. This build refuses to *use* such an entry, and it does not get to delete it: only the user
// removing the server, or joining one with the same id, retires a preserved entry, and
// `RemoteServerStore` owns both of those. The one thing that displaces an entry without retiring it
// is a readable server arriving on the same id -- see `serializeStoredRemoteServers`, which writes
// the readable one because a file with two entries under one id is worse than either alone.
//
// The same applies to the selection. If the active server is a preserved entry, this build cannot
// select it, so it runs on the local server -- but the id stays in the file, so the build that can
// read the entry still finds the user on it.
//
// Versions 1 and 2 differ from 3 only in fields this reader already treats as optional, so an upgrade
// is a re-tag. A version this build does not know is refused outright: it was written by a newer
// Dani-Dex, and guessing at it would replace a file that build can still read.
