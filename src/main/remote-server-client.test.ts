// One Team API call: which protocol the two ends agree on, which headers carry that agreement, how a
// host's refusal is classified, and what an ambiguous failure costs on retry. The consequences here
// belong to `remote-server-client.ts` and to `remote-server-connection-status.ts`, which decides what
// a failure means for the user, and they break independently of the live event channel.
//
// Assertions read `stubTeamFetch(...).requests(path)` after the call. An `expect` inside a route body
// reports the mock's source location and, worse, cannot fail at all when the route is never reached.
