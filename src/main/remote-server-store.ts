// changes either. Nothing outside this file may change persisted server state.
//
// That is a type, not a convention. `StoredRemoteServerView` is `Readonly`, so a caller that reaches
// for `server.name = ...` gets a compile error. Until 2026-09 there was no such view: the manager's
// `#requireServer` handed back a live element of the array this file writes, and six call sites
// mutated through it. They worked only because whichever `#persist()` happened to run next
// snapshotted the whole state -- so a mutation with no persist after it changed how the app behaved
// until some later, unrelated write, and nothing except reading both call sites could see that.
//
// Every method here that changes state also writes the file, with one named exception:
// `setActiveServerId` leaves the write to its caller, because selecting a server has to be able to
// roll the selection back when the write fails. That is why `persist` is public. Do not add a second
// exception -- a mutation whose write is somebody else's job is the hazard this module exists to end.
