 * across two displays is marked by both overlays, each drawing the part that falls on it.
 *
 * It floats over every other window. macOS keeps no window of one application between two windows
 * of another - `moveAbove` and `moveTop` both return without an error and change nothing - and a
 * rim the user cannot see says nothing about where the agent works, so the rim stays in sight even
 * while the window it marks is covered.
 *
 * Everything the controller touches is injected, so the placement rules are tested without a
 * desktop: the driver read, the window factory, the load and the send are all the caller's.
