// Binding a group of endpoints to the implementations behind them.
//
// A registrar used to be a sequence of `handleTrusted(IPC_CHANNELS.x, ...)` calls, and nothing said
// the sequence was complete. A channel declared in `packages/contracts` and never registered
// compiled, shipped, and surfaced as "No handler registered for 'agent:list-models'" the first time
// a user opened the feature. A static scan of the source text was what noticed, which meant the
// check lived in a test that had to re-implement enough of the language to find the calls.
//
// Here a registrar hands back an object keyed by endpoint name instead. `GroupHandlers<G>` is a
// mapped type over the group's request endpoints, so a missing key is TS2741, a stray key is TS2353,
// and a renamed endpoint is both at once. The checker does the whole job, on the run that already
// checks everything else, and it names the endpoint in the diagnostic.
//
// Only request endpoints appear. An event travels main-to-renderer through `sendToRenderer` and has
// no handler to bind, so including it would ask every registrar for a key it cannot fill.
