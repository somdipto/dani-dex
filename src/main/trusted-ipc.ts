// convention: a registration that does not say how its payload decodes is a compile error, not a
// hole for review to catch. The decoder is a plain `(value: unknown) => Payload`, so it can be a
// hand-written parser, a zod `parse`, or anything else, without changing a call site.

// overload and then be called with nothing. The renderer's payload is dropped rather than passed on,
// so no unvalidated value reaches a handler either way — but the registration compiles while quietly
// meaning something else, which is the ambiguity this change exists to remove. Constraining the
// parameter tuple's own length rejects all three, and says why in the diagnostic.
