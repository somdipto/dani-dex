// What a route module says when it is asked about a request.
//
// `"unmatched"` means the module recognised nothing and wrote nothing, so the router may keep
// asking. `"handled"` means the response is already on the wire and the router must stop - anything
// it does afterwards is an `ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT` in its own error path. The repository does not
// enable `noImplicitReturns`, so a module that falls out of its own end returns `undefined`, which
// reads as `"unmatched"` and turns a route that should have answered into a silent 404. The rule
// that closes that gap is a written one: the last statement of every route module is
// `return "unmatched"`.

//
// The raw `request` and the whole parsed `url` are both here on purpose. Routes read headers off
// the request that no parsed field could carry - the forwarding headers behind `publicHttpBaseUrl`,
// the content type of an avatar upload, the socket address the rate limiter keys on - and about
// fifteen of them read `url.searchParams`. `protocol` and `capabilities` are computed once here so
// that a route which needs them cannot disagree with the values `json` will encode against.
//
// `json` and `empty` are bound closures rather than methods, so a module can destructure them, and
// they return `RouteOutcome` so that every `return json(...)` is also the statement that stops the
// router.
