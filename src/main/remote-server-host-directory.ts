// How the host list held by the account service reconciles with the servers stored on this
// computer. The account service is the authority on *which* hosts exist for this user; the stored
// entry is the authority on *which key* we already pinned for one. Merging them is the whole job
// of this file, and it is a pure function so the merge can be read without a socket or a disk.
//
// Two rules are load-bearing and neither is obvious from the call site:
//
//   - **A pinned key survives a changed advertisement.** If a stored host already carries a
//     `publicKey`, that key wins over whatever the directory advertises now. Otherwise the
//     advertised key is accepted only when it agrees with the stored fingerprint, or when there is
//     no stored fingerprint to disagree with. This is what makes an account-service compromise
//     insufficient to silently re-key a host the user already trusts. It holds for an entry the
//     store could not decode as well -- those are absent from `servers`, so `preservedIdentities`
//     carries their key and fingerprint here. Reading an entry and honouring its pin are separate
//     questions, and the second one has to answer yes either way.
//   - **The directory owns the list.** A stored WebRTC host missing from the directory is dropped,
//     and so is every non-WebRTC server unless `keepOtherTransports` is set. That flag is on only
//     in development builds, which is why a released build treats the account directory as the
//     complete answer rather than a set of additions.
//
// Order is preserved deliberately: surviving stored servers keep their positions, and hosts the
// user has not seen before are appended in directory order. The user drags this list.
