// What Dani-Dex puts between an agent's driver proxy and the driver daemon.
//
// The daemon answers one lease at a time and tells no lease about another, so Dani-Dex cannot ask it
// which window an agent works in: `list_sessions` and `get_agent_cursor_state` report only the
// lease that asks, and `history` is refused to anything but the local command line. Front-to-back
// window order is no answer either, because the driver acts in the background by design and leaves
// the order alone, and because the user's own clicks move it.
//
// Dani-Dex does own one thing: the address it hands the providers. This listens on an address of its
// own, forwards every byte to the daemon unchanged, and reads the few fields it needs out of the
// request line - which application, which window, and which point the agent asked the daemon to
// act on.
//
// It carries no policy. It refuses nothing, rewrites nothing and delays nothing: a tap that could
// change an action would be a second, quieter place where Computer Use is decided.
