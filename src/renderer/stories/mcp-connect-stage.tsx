/**
 * The stage both connect dialogs are reviewed on.
 *
 * One story each, driven by controls, rather than a story per state: the dialog's states are what a
 * server answers with, so answering differently is the whole difference between them. The connection
 * reads the configuration it is given - a wrong key fails, no key passes where none is asked for -
 * so the header and environment writes are under review here as much as the layout.
 *
 * A sign-in has no separate answer to give here. The browser round trip belongs to the bridge the
 * listing installs, behind the same connect attempt, so "never answers" is what waiting looks like.
