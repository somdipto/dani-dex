 * The agent cursor Dani-Dex draws itself.
 *
 * The driver draws one of its own, over the main screen and at the desktop's coordinates inside it,
 * so on a desktop of more than one display it lands as far from the work as that screen's origin is
 * from the desktop's. Dani-Dex then asks the driver for no cursor and draws this one instead, in the
 * overlay that already covers every display, where one set of coordinates holds everywhere.
 *
 * It is the same dart the Dani-Dex driver theme draws: a shape no desktop pointer has, because the
 * one thing it has to say is that something other than the user is driving this computer.
 *
 * It is decoration for a screen reader. The rim around the window carries the announcement, and a
 * point that moves with every click would otherwise interrupt the user many times a second.
