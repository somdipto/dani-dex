 * fall inward. It does not move: the agent works for minutes at a time, and anything that turns or
 * breathes for that long pulls the eye away from the work.
 *
 * What another window covers is cut away. The rim is drawn on an overlay that floats over the whole
 * desktop, because macOS keeps no window of one application between two windows of another, so a
 * rim drawn whole would lie over the window in front and read as a rim around that one instead.
 *
 * It draws nothing that can be pressed: the surface that carries it is click-through, and this
 * component holds no control of its own, so it cannot take a click away from the window under it.
