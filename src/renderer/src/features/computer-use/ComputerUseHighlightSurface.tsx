/**
 * The whole content of the overlay window Dani-Dex lays over the desktop while an agent works.
 *
 * The window covers the whole desktop and stays where it is; this surface draws the rim at the
 * place main sends, so following a window the user drags costs a repaint rather than a window move
 * on every frame. The same message carries the agent cursor, which is drawn here wherever the
 * driver draws none.
 *
 * The window is transparent, click-through and never focused, so this surface holds no control and
 * invokes nothing: the placement arrives on a one-way channel. That keeps a window which floats
 * over another application free of any channel it could be driven through.
