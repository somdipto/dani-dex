/**
 * First run and the review of it: what the user chose during onboarding, the
 * invitation that may have brought them here, and the flow reopened later to
 * change either.
 *
 * Ungated - see `app-providers.tsx` for why no provider gates during the
 * migration. `setupLoaded()` is the gate this domain will eventually offer;
 * until then `AppAccessGate` reads it directly, which is where the null already
 * matters.
 *
 * Two neighbours worth explaining, because neither sits where a first reading
 * would put it:
 *
 * - **`permissionsOpen` lives here, not with the other dialogs.** It renders the
 *   onboarding flow again in review mode, and `saveSetup` closes it in the same
 *   `flush` that stores the new state. Settings is nested under this domain, so
 *   a `settings.tsx` owner would be a dependency pointing the wrong way.
 * - **`joinRemoteDuringSetup` is not here**, though it is a setup action. It
 *   joins a server first, and joining is the servers domain, which is nested
 *   under this one. It belongs to whichever context owns `joinServer` and can
 *   read `saveSetup` from here.
