/**
 * What the renderer remembers about reads it has asked for but not settled.
 *
 * All three are keyed by `agentConversationKey(serverId, agentId)`, and all three
 * are consulted by a promise that can outlive the workspace that started it: a
 * `markConversationRead` issued on one server may still be in flight when the
 * user moves to another. That is why they sit above the per-server scope rather
 * than inside it - a rejection that lands after the switch has to leave its retry
 * marker where the scope that comes back will find it, or the failed read is
 * silently forgotten and the message stays unread forever.
 *
 * `agentChatsRetriedOnOpen` is deliberately *not* here. It is keyed by agent id
 * alone, it means "this open already retried once", and an open belongs to the
 * workspace the user is looking at, so it stays with the conversation scope and
 * dies with it.
