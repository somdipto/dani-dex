 * arrives both on reconnect and as a compact update that main may have had to
 * truncate. `attentionComplete` is the flag that separates the two: when it is
 * true the snapshot lists every prompt and approval there is, so anything the
 * renderer still shows and the snapshot omits is gone; when it is false the
 * snapshot is a partial view and dropping what it omits would clear a prompt
 * the user is looking at.
 *
 * Kept apart from `agent-event-bridge.tsx` because that file is routing - one
 * event, several domains - while this is the arithmetic underneath it, and the
 * arithmetic is where the reconnect edge cases live.

 * answer had arrived. Seeding it unfiltered remounts `QuestionPromptBubble` on
 * its first page - the bubble hides the questions in local state that the
 * remount throws away - and the user is asked again. The two markers outlive the
 * scope for exactly this window; `reconcileAttentionPrompts` consults the
 * submitted one against main's snapshots, and this consults both against the
 * coordinator's, which is the only other way a prompt enters the scope.
 *
 * Only prompts are filtered. A browser takeover leaves `pendingPrompts` the
 * moment main accepts the response, so the projection above this has already
