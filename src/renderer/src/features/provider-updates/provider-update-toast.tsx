/**
 * The provider update, as one notification the user acts on and then watches.
 *
 * The notification is raised once and held for the whole flow. This is the point of the module:
 * calling `toast()` a second time with the same id does not edit what is on screen, it reconciles
 * the store entry, and Solid rebuilds the list row from it. The `<li>` is thrown away for a new one
 * that mounts at zero height with the enter animation, and a download that reports every hundred
 * milliseconds does that a dozen times a second - which is the jumping this module exists to avoid.
 *
 * So everything that changes after the notification opens is a signal read inside the element that
 * is already there. The title is a function sonner calls again, and the detail and the action button
 * are elements built once, in their own reactive root, that update themselves in place.
 *
 * Two things follow from holding one toast open. Its dismiss timer cannot be re-armed, so the
 * settled notification counts itself out here. And the action button is ours rather than sonner's,
 * because sonner renders its own button for as long as an action exists, and an update that has
 * finished has nothing left to offer.
 *
 * The Toaster is already mounted once in `App.tsx`, outside every provider, and `toast` is the
 * handle onto it.
