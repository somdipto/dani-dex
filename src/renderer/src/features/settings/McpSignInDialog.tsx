/**
 * The way in that leaves the app: the server's own page asks, and this side only learns whether the
 * connection that follows works. The button says where the user is going, the way every other button
 * that opens a browser does.
 *
 * Nothing about the sign-in happens here, and nothing about it is faked here either. The connect
 * attempt is what starts it: the test the main process runs opens the browser, waits for the grant
 * to come back on the address the main process listens on, and only then answers. So this dialog is the shell, the
 * server's own words, and one button, and `busy()` covers the whole trip rather than a request.
 *
 * A grant is a secret, so it never reaches this side. What comes back is the same pass or fail a
 * test of any other server gives.
