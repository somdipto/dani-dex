/**
 * The shared slab every composer notice uses: a warning-toned card in the queue's shape, above the
 * input and under the queue, because the user reads that column top to bottom before they send.
 *
 * `tone` is the only difference between the states. It is `danger` when the user cannot send at all
 * and the wait is not in their hands, and `warning` when one press puts the state right.
 *
 * `onDismiss` decides the rest. A notice the user can clear gets the close button, Escape, and
 * `role="alert"`, because a state the user did not ask for has to announce itself. The states they
 * walked into - a signed-out provider, a spent plan window - stay until they are resolved, so they
 * only report. `title` is optional: a failure the provider already stated in a sentence gains
 * nothing from a label that repeats the word "error" above it.
