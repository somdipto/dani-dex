/**
 * The deep links, and nothing else.
 *
 * This used to hold the first per-server load and the two window listeners as
 * well. Both moved into `server-scope.tsx` when the per-server state became a
 * keyed subtree: the load because first mount and server switch are now the same
 * mount, and the listeners because both read scoped state.
 *
 * What is left genuinely belongs above that boundary. An invite can arrive
 * before any server exists, has to survive the switch it causes, and spans
 * setup, auth and servers - so it is registered once, for the life of the
 * window.
 *
 * A plugin link is the same problem with a shorter answer: it opens the
 * marketplace on one listing, and installs nothing.
 *
 * The MCP notice below belongs here for the same reason: the MCP list is
 * machine-scoped, the notice is owed once per computer and not once per
 * workspace, and it has to reach a user who never opens the MCP panel.
