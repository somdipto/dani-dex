/**
 * What the renderer is running inside: which build and OS, whether the window
 * has focus, and the two flags fixed by how the app was mounted.
 *
 * The outermost domain, and deliberately ungated. Gating it on `appInfo` would
 * read well - everything below could treat the build as known - but it would
 * also hold back every provider under it, and with them the bootstrap loads
 * that run in parallel with `getAppInfo` today. The view already gates on
 * `appInfo()` where the null actually matters, so the gate would buy a narrower
 * type nowhere and cost a serialized startup everywhere.
 *
 * `appFocused` is maintained here and read by anything that treats a focused
 * window as "the user is looking at this". Domains that need to *act* when
 * focus returns listen for the event themselves rather than reacting to this
 * signal: the listener registered here runs first, because this provider is
 * created first, so the flag is already true by the time theirs runs.
