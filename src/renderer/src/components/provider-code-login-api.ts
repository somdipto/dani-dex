/**
 * What a surface needs to run a code sign-in, as one optional prop.
 *
 * Grouped like `ProviderKeyApi` is for Settings, and for the same reason: onboarding and the
 * settings modal both offer the sign-in and are both rendered from stories and tests with no
 * provider behind them, so the whole feature is one object that is either there or not, rather
 * than six callbacks each surface has to remember to pass together.
 *
 * The flow itself lives in the providers store. Everything here is a reader or a verb, because the
 * dialog that ends up on screen decides nothing: the phase arrives from main, and the ending
 * closes the dialog and becomes a notification the store raises.
