/**
 * Signing in to a coding provider with a code instead of this computer's browser.
 *
 * The browser sign-in every provider row offers today hands the account off to whatever browser
 * this computer opens, and comes back through it. That fails wherever the hand-off cannot close -
 * a machine with no browser, a remote session, a browser already signed in to the wrong account.
 * The code flow moves the sign-in to a device the user already trusts: Dani-Dex asks the provider
 * for a short-lived code, shows it, and waits. The user opens the verification page on a phone or
 * another browser, types the code there, and the provider tells Dani-Dex it is done.
 *
 * The code on screen is the whole point of the flow and is safe to read out: it is a one-time
 * handle the provider issues, it expires, and it authorises nothing on its own. The token the
 * provider returns for it never reaches this component - the main process keeps it, and what comes
 * back here is a phase and, on success, the account name. So there is nothing here to redact.
 *
 * The dialog covers the waiting only. How the sign-in ended - connected, expired, refused - is a
 * notification, because by then the user has been away on another device and the thing they come
 * back to should not be a modal they have to dismiss before they can use the app.
 *
 * This component decides nothing. It renders one phase of the flow and reports what the user did,
 * because the flow itself lives one side of the IPC boundary away and a dialog that polled would
 * be a second copy of it. That also makes every phase reachable in Storybook.
