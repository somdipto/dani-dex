/**
 * The inline error feed of an agent's message list.
 *
 * It sits above the per-server scope, and that placement is the whole point: an
 * error is reported by whichever command failed, and a command can outlive the
 * workspace it was issued from. A voice message whose transcription resolves
 * after the user has moved to another server still sends to the server it was
 * dictated on, so its rejection has to be waiting when they come back.
 *
 * Keys are `agentConversationKey(serverId, agentId)`, so entries for a server you
 * are not looking at are unreachable rather than merely unrendered - which is
 * why nothing prunes this on a switch, and why a shared owner is safe.
