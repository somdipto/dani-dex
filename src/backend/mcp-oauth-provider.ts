/**
 * The OAuth client Dani-Dex is, for an http MCP server that asks its users to sign in.
 *
 * Every one of the six sign-in listings used to reach its server through `npx -y mcp-remote`, a
 * third-party program that kept the refresh token in a file of its own. A token Dani-Dex cannot see
 * is a token it cannot redact, and redaction is not optional here - so the grant, the registration
 * and the token set move into Dani-Dex's own encrypted store, and the bridge goes away.
 *
 * Almost none of the protocol is written here. `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` already does RFC 9728
 * discovery, RFC 7591 registration, PKCE and the refresh; what it asks for is one object that says
 * where to keep the results and how to reach a browser. That object is `McpOAuthClientProvider`,
 * and `McpOAuth` is the one place that builds it, so the pending sign-ins have a single home the
 * deep link can answer.
 *
 * A server is keyed by its URL and nothing else. Two rows naming the same URL are the same account
 * to the server, so they are the same account here.
