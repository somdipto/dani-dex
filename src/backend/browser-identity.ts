/**
 * Per-site request identity for the embedded browser.
 *
 * One shared session means one page identity: native everywhere, which Google reads as a
 * known client. A few allowlists read the other way, so those hosts get the build and
 * product tokens scrubbed back out, request by request. Page JavaScript always sees the
 * native string; only listed hosts are ever rewritten, so one host's gate cannot change
 * another's verdict.
 *
 * To add a site: append a row with the measured reason and cover it with an opt-in live
 * probe in `scripts/browser-smoke-electron.ts` (`--*-live`), the way WhatsApp is covered.
 * The first match in table order wins, and anything unmatched stays native.
