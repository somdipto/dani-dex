/**
 * What this app has already handed to a provider process: the MCP server names, and the secret
 * values behind them.
 *
 * A provider keeps the configuration it was given until its process stops. The user can edit a
 * credential, or disable a server, while that process still runs - `applyPendingRuntimeRefresh`
 * waits for the active turn on purpose - and the store then no longer names the value the process
 * holds. A reader that redacts against the configuration as it stands now would let that value
 * through, in the one line most likely to quote it: the CLI's own report of the failed connection.
 *
 * So the record only grows, for the life of the app. It is a few strings, and the cost of keeping a
 * value too long is a masked word in a log line, while the cost of dropping one too early is a
 * credential in a log file and in a renderer error event.
