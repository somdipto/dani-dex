 * What a new agent starts on in a development build, in place of the built-in `codex` default.

 * choice rather than a user's, so it is named here once and read by both the app and
 * `scripts/seed-dev-state.ts`: the seeded showcase agents and an agent created by hand have to
 * agree, or a dev profile shows two different answers to the same question.
 *
 * It is a default, never an override. A recorded preference -- the provider and model setup or
 * Settings wrote -- wins, because that one is the developer saying what they want.

 * The development default as a model of the live catalog, or `null` to leave the built-in default

 *
 * Two conditions, because the catalog alone does not say a model can answer. `opencode-go/` is the
 * paid tier: without an OpenCode Go key, and without the user's own OpenCode sign-in, the CLI lists
 * the free tier only -- but a CLI that lists the Go catalog from a sign-in Dani-Dex cannot see is
 * still one whose provider has to be installed, current and signed in before an agent reaches it.
 * A model that fails either test is not a default, it is a first turn that answers
 * "Invalid API key.".
 *
 * The effort is the one asked for while the model supports it, and the model's own default
 * otherwise, so a catalog that reports a narrower set than expected downgrades the effort rather
 * than writing an effort the provider will reject.
