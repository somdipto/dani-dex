 * Copying an agent, and the window between the copy existing and the user accepting it.
 *
 * A duplicate is created in the database before the user has confirmed where it goes, so for that
 * window it is a real row that must not behave like a real agent: it is hidden from `listAgents`, it
 * never drains its queue, its routines never fire, and `Unknown agent` is the honest answer for it.
 * Every path out of that window — commit, delete, or a failed copy — has to clear the same four
 * maps, which is why they live in one class rather than beside the code that happens to set them.
 *
 * The copy itself is guarded twice over. `#duplicatingAgents` refuses a second concurrent copy of one
 * source; `#commitQueue` serialises commits so two duplications cannot interleave their store
 * writes; and the source signature is re-compared after every step, so an agent edited mid-copy
 * aborts rather than producing a duplicate that matches neither state.
