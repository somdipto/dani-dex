/**
 * Answers one question for `AttentionRegistry`: may this approval be accepted without asking?
 *
 * A grant covers every approval kind the agent raises, `permissions` included. An agent asks to
 * widen its filesystem or network reach before it can do the ordinary work the grant was given for,
 * so holding that class back left one card for each agent that the user could not turn off.
 *
 * Hosted-site publishing, replacement and deletion require Turbo for automatic approval.
 * Validated mutations still run through the hosted-site coordinator.
 * Browser takeover is a separate flow with its own gate and is never asked about here.
