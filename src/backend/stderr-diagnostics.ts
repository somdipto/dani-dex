// Reading a provider CLI's stderr as records, not as chunks.
//
// A `data` event carries whatever the pipe held, so it ends wherever the pipe filled up: often in the
// middle of a JSON record the CLI is writing. Redaction reads one string at a time and cannot know
// that a string is half of something, so a record split across two chunks used to pass its second
// half through untouched, credentials and all. Records are held here until they are whole, and only
// whole records are redacted. A record usually ends at the next newline, but a CLI may pretty-print
// one payload over several lines, and a line of such a payload read on its own loses the parent key
// that tells the redactor what it holds.
//
// The text is read once, left to right: every character is classified as it arrives, and the state
// of that scan (bracket depth, whether it is inside a string) is what survives between chunks. A
// scan that started again at each newline would walk the whole record every time, which a CLI could
// turn into seconds of blocked main process with one long payload.
