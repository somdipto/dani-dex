 * into `McpServerConfig.headers` would be one the panel shows, the Team API carries to a remote
 * administrator, and a user can edit into something Dani-Dex then refreshes over. Injected at the
 * hand-off, it is a value `McpHandoffLog` has already seen, so every log, export and send path
 * removes it.
 *
 * A header the user typed wins. Someone who pasted their own `Authorization` has said which
 * credential this server takes, and silently replacing it would be Dani-Dex overruling them with an
 * account they did not choose.
